### UT-IT Assignment
#### Scala

#### Description

This is a Scala project that implements Different Modules.
It contains files for basic logical questions, like to find factorial, or check for duplicate elements in a List.
It has a file that checks if the password strength is strong or not.
TDD Approach is followed and all possible corner cases are tried to be covered.


### ModuleOne questions: 
Write the code and test cases following the TDD approach to check the
Strength of the provided Password. A password is considered strong If It
follows the following constraints:
● The String must contain uppercase and lowerrcase letters.
● The String must have Alphanumeric Characters as well as Special
Characters but the only allowed special characters are {%@#&amp;$}.
● The password must not contain the users name.


Given an List of elements check for duplicate elements.
● Find the factorial of a given number.

#### ModuleTwo 
Write the unit and integration test cases after completing the
implementation of the following classes. The framework has already been
created and most of the implementation of methods already exists. Add the
following validation in respective classes.
a) User Validation Class:
i. Checks if company exists in database
ii. Checks if email id is valid.
b) Company Validation Class:
i. Company should not already exists in database
ii. Checks if email id is valid.
c) Email Validation Class : Checks if email is valid.

   -  Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.

   -  Run the command sbt. This will start the sbt console.

   -  Type run in the sbt console to run your Scala project.

   -   Type test in the sbt console to run your Scala tests.

   -  After making changes to your code, use the compile command to compile the changes.
